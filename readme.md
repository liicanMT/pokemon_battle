# 宝可梦对战
- 这是一个基于Python的小游戏程序。因为使用的代码非常非常简单，我相信它可以在任何版本的Python上运行。
- 我在学习了Python的基础代码之后，想要运用所学的代码“创造”些什么。于是在2018年写了这个代码，并在2021年打包成了exe文件。
- 这是一个非常基础非常基础的程序，但是它代表了我当时对编程的热爱。在最近（2022.2）我学习了关于Git的使用，于是我决定把这些内容放到Github上来
- 它是我的第一个程序，希望你能够喜欢。



# Pokemon_Battle
- This is a game based on Python. I believe you can run it without the limits of the versions because the code is very primary.
- After learning some basic code of Python I wanted to "create" something depending on what I learned. So I wrote it in 2018 and pack it into an executable program in 2021.
- This is a very primary and basic programme, however, it represented my love for programming at the time. Recently (2022.2), I learned something about Git, so I decided to put it on Github
- It is my first program, and I hope you like it.

# Update Diary
## 2020.2.16
- Push codes on GitHub firstly.

## 2020.2.17
- Bug found: the exe program could only seen in Chinses language system. In English lanaguage system the message can't be read. 
- I thought it should be fixed by editing the words information but I have no time to fix it now. Sorry for that.
